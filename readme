#ITM Expansions Bot

Inspired by the npm expansions that appear in the header of npmjs.org, I decided to make a Slack bot that would expand the intials of ITM TwentyFirst,
the company I work for.

The bot is fueled by a database of hand-crafted expansions and it will reply with a random one any time someone says "expand ITM" in a channel.

If you want to add to the list make a pull request to expansions.csv.
